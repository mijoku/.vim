# My VIM settings
Nothing special.

- [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter) for fancy git diff-marks in the sign column
- [vim-lastplace](https://github.com/farmergreg/vim-lastplace) for returning to the last edited position in files
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) for the little bit of eye-candy (nerd-font needs to be used,

## Custom key-bindings
